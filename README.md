- Undo and redo any steps.
- Delete step by entering Delete Mode and touch the step.
- Rotate the image.
- Pick name for the image.
- Save the image locally and in Photo.

**Uses**

# - Design Patterns

Check this link for used [Design Patterns](DESIGN_PATTERNS.md)

# - **Caching**

I used **CoreData** in caching sketching because I deal with one sketch every time and make CRUD operation on it.

I thought to use **documents directory** or **UserDefaults** but if I want to edit sketch I will get all sketches and edit the sketch then save all sketches again.
